# QUORUM TRUFFLE BOX

This truffle box makes it easy for you to quickly deploy on a quorum node. By default, it uses the default node account generated when a new Quorum node is created. To not use the default node account, simply change the mnemonic or private key in password.js.


## Password.js

Input your mnemonic and Quoroum node RPC into this file. To create your own node, we recommend you to try out Chainstack's 2 week trial [here](https://console.chainstack.com).

To run Quorum nodes locally, head over to truffle's Quorum documentation [here](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/working-with-quorum)
